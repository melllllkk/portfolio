      <h3 id="ex-title">AP CSA</h3>
      <p id="ex-text">
        My initial exposure to programming occurred during my sophomore year of high school when I enrolled in AP CSA.
        Although grasping the fundamental principles of programming was not particularly challenging, I
        had difficulty comprehending the underlying logic essential for writing functional programs. I struggled with
        effectively employing the concepts to develop programs capable of solving problem sets. Consequently, during the
        AP exam, I was unable to provide answers to any of the free reponse questions due to my lack of understanding
        regarding the tasks they demanded. This marked the first instance in which I felt genuinely defeated during an
        examination. Nevertheless, this setback served as motivation for me to strive for a deeper understanding in
        programming.
